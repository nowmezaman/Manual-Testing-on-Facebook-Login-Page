# What is this project about?
This project provides a comprehensive set of test artifacts for the login functionality of the Facebook social media platform. It includes well-defined test cases, test scenarios, a test summary report, bug reports, and key test metrics. The objective is to support manual testers in systematically planning, executing, and monitoring their testing activities with clarity and efficiency.

# Why was this project created?
The purpose of this repository is to offer a comprehensive suite of test cases covering various aspects of Facebookâ€™s login page, including user account authentication, input validation, error handling, and site responsiveness. It is designed to assist testers in evaluating the reliability, usability, and functionality of the login feature through well-structured manual testing processes.

# Test Cases
The test cases are organized into different categories based on the login features and functionalities of Facebook. Each test case should include the following information:

1. Test case ID
2. Module
3. Type of testing
4. Features
5. Test case description
6. Expected results
7. Actual results
8. Test data
9. Reproducing steps
10. Bug screenshot
11. Final result
12. Remarks

# Test Scenarios
The scenarios consist of detailed scenarios that represent different user workflows or use cases within the system. Scenarios help testers understand the system's behavior from end-users' perspectives and ensure that all user interactions are thoroughly tested.

# Reports
The reports are dedicated to storing various reports generated during manual testing. Reports may include bug reports, test execution reports, test summary reports, and any other relevant documentation. These reports provide valuable insights into the testing progress, identified issues, and overall test results.

# Test Metrics
The test-metrics contain metrics and measurements related to manual testing. Testers can track metrics such as test coverage, defect density, test execution time, and other relevant metrics to assess the quality and progress of testing activities. The metrics help identify areas of improvement and provide quantitative data for making informed decisions.
